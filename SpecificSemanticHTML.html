                            As the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta is a melting pot of cultures from all ethnic groups in
                            the
                            country. Although Betawi people are Jakarta's indigenous community, the city's culture
                            represents many languages and ethnic groups, favouring differences in religion, tradition,
                            and
                            linguistics, rather than a single, dominant culture. Jakarta is dominated by Javanese
                            people,
                            followed by Betawi people and Sundanese people

                            Jakarta covers 661.23 km2 (255.30 sq mi), the smallest among any Indonesian provinces.
                            However,
                            its metropolitan area covers 6,392 km2 (2,468 sq mi), which extends into the two bordering
                            provinces of West Java and Banten.[51] The Greater Jakarta area includes three bordering
                            regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang Regency and Bogor Regency) and five adjacent cities
                            (Bogor,

                            Jakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on
                            Jakarta Bay, an inlet of the Java Sea. It is strategically located near the Sunda Strait.
                            The
                            northern part of Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level,[52] and
                            subject
                            to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian
                            capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along with East Timor's Dili).
                            Officially,
                            the area of the Jakarta Special District is 661.23 km2 (255 sq mi) of land area and 6,977
                            km2
                            (2,694 sq mi) of sea area.[53] The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of
                            Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.

                            Jakarta lies in a low and flat alluvial plain, ranging from −2 to 91 m (−7 to 299 ft) with
                            an
                            average elevation of 8 m (26 ft) above sea level with historically extensive swampy areas.
                            Some
                            parts of the city have been constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur around the
                            area.[54]
                            Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They are Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan,
                            Cipinang,
                            Angke, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and
                            Grogol
                            River.[55][56] They flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, then across the
                            city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western
                            and
                            eastern districts. These rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient
                            drainage
                            due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding.

                            Moreover, Jakarta is sinking about 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) each year, and up to 20 cm
                            (7.9
                            in) in the northern coastal areas. After a feasibility study, a ring dyke known as Giant Sea
                            Wall Jakarta is under construction around Jakarta Bay to help cope with the threat from the
                            sea.
                            The dyke will be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against
                            seawater
                            and function as a toll road. The project is expected to be completed by 2025.[57] In January
                            2014, the central government agreed to build two dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a 1.2 km (0.75 mi)
                            tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease flooding in the city.[58] Nowadays, a
                            1.2
                            km (0.75 mi), with capacity 60 m3 (2,100 cu ft) per second, underground water tunnel between
                            Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River
                            overflows.[59] In 2023, the New York Times reported that in some places Jakarta is sinking
                            up to
                            12 inches (30 cm) annually.[60]

                            Environmental advocates point out that subsidence is driven by the extraction of
                            groundwater,
                            much of it illegal. Furthermore, the government's lack of strict regulation amplifies the
                            issue
                            as many recently built high-rise buildings, corporations, and factories around Jakarta opt
                            for
                            illegally extracting groundwater. In fact, in a recent inspection of 80 buildings in Jalan
                            Thamrin, a busy road lined with skyscrapers and shopping malls, 56 buildings had a
                            groundwater
                            pump, and 33 were pumping groundwater illegally.[61] This could be halted by stopping
                            extraction
                            (as the city of Tokyo has done), increasing efficiency, and finding other sources for water
                            use.
                            Moreover, increasing regulation through higher taxes or limiting groundwater pumping has
                            proven
                            to help cities like Shanghai, Tokyo, and San Jose relieve their subsidence issue.[62] The
                            rivers
                            of Jakarta are highly polluted and currently unsuitable for drinking water.[63]

                            Jakarta, faces significant air pollution, particularly during the dry season from August to
                            December. Dry air during this period allows pollutants to remain suspended in the atmosphere
                            for
                            extended periods, contributing to poor air quality.[64][65]

                            Indonesia is the largest economy of ASEAN, and Jakarta is the economic nerve centre of the
                            Indonesian archipelago. Jakarta's nominal GDP was US$203.702 billion and PPP GDP was

                            wealth of at least US$1 billion and 18 live in Jakarta.[161] The cost of living continues to
                            rise. Both land prices and rents have become expensive. Mercer's 2017 Cost of Living Survey
                            ranked Jakarta as 88th costliest city in the world for expatriates.[162] Industrial

                            The north coast area of western Java including Jakarta was the location of prehistoric Buni
                            culture that flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD.[23] The area in and around modern Jakarta was
                            part of the 4th-century Sundanese kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms
                            in
                            Indonesia.[24] The area of North Jakarta around Tugu became a populated settlement in the
                            early
                            5th century. The Tugu inscription (probably written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh
                            hamlet, Tugu village, Koja, North Jakarta, mentions that King Purnawarman of Tarumanagara
                            undertook hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga
                            river and the Gomati river near his capital.[25] Following the decline of Tarumanagara, its
                            territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda. From the
                            7th
                            to the early 13th century, the port of Sunda was under the Srivijaya maritime empire.
                            According
                            to the Chinese source, Chu-fan-chi, written circa 1225, Chou Ju-kua reported in the early
                            13th
                            century that Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java
                            (Sunda).[26]
                            The source says the port of Sunda is strategic and thriving, mentioning pepper from Sunda as
                            among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture, and their houses were built on
                            wooden piles.[27] The harbour area became known as Sunda Kelapa (Sundanese: ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮊᮨᮜᮕ) and
                            by
                            the 14th century, it was an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom.

                            The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 while looking
                            for
                            a route to obtain spices.[28] The Sunda Kingdom made an alliance treaty with the Portuguese
                            by
                            allowing them to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of Demak Sultanate
                            from
                            central Java.[19] In 1527, Fatahillah, a Pasai-born military commander of Demak attacked and
                            conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta,[19]
                            and
                            became a fiefdom of the Banten Sultanate, which became a major Southeast Asian trading
                            centre.

                            arrived in
                            1596. In 1602, an English East India Company (EIC) voyage led by Sir James Lancaster arrived
                            in
                            Aceh and sailed on to Banten, where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site
                            became
                            the centre of English trade in the Indonesian archipelago until 1682.[29] Jayawikarta is
                            thought
                            to have made trading connections with the English merchants, who were rivals with the Dutch,
                            by
                            allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.[28]

                            When relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his soldiers attacked
                            the
                            Dutch fortress. His army and their EIC allies, however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part
                            owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The Dutch burned the EIC trading post
                            and
                            forced them to retreat to their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power, and they
                            renamed
                            the city Batavia in 1619.

                        <p>
                            Commercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially Chinese and Arab
                            immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as
                            the
                            colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a
                            revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740, and the
                            following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls.[30] At the
                            beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number that
                            changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded were fabrics,
                            mainly
                            imported cotton, batik and clothing worn by Arab communities.[31]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 forced residents to
                            move
                            away from the port. The Koningsplein, now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing
                            park
                            of Menteng was started in 1913,[32] and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential
                            area.[30] By 1930, Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants,[33] including 37,067
                            Europeans.[34] The city was expanded in 1935 through the annexation of the town of Meester
                            Cornelis, modern Jatinegara.[35]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On 5 March 1942, the Japanese captured Batavia from Dutch control, and the city was named
                            Jakarta (Jakarta Special City (ジャカルタ特別市, Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi), under the special status
                            that
                            was assigned to the city). After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally
                            recognised
                            until full Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. The city, now renamed Jakarta, was
                            officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.

                            After World War II ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August
                            1945,[36]
                            and the government of Jakarta City was changed into the Jakarta National Administration in
                            the
                            following month. During the Indonesian National Revolution, Indonesian Republicans withdrew
                            from
                            Allied-occupied Jakarta and established their capital in Yogyakarta.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After securing full independence, Jakarta again became the national capital in 1950.[30]
                            With
                            Jakarta selected to host the 1962 Asian Games, Sukarno, envisaging Jakarta as a great
                            international city, instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic
                            and
                            modernist architecture.[37] Projects included a cloverleaf interchange, a major boulevard
                            (Jalan
                            MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, Hotel Indonesia, a shopping
                            centre, and a new building intended to be the headquarters of CONEFO. In October 1965,
                            Jakarta
                            was the site of an abortive coup attempt in which six top generals were killed,
                            precipitating a
                            violent anti-communist purge which killed at least 500,000 people, including some ethnic
                            Chinese.[38] The event marked the beginning of Suharto's New Order. The first government was
                            led
                            by a mayor until the end of 1960 when the office was changed to that of a governor. The last
                            mayor of Jakarta was Soediro until he was replaced by Soemarno Sosroatmodjo as governor.

                        <p>
                            In 1966, Jakarta was declared a 'special capital region' (Daerah Khusus Ibukota), with a
                            status
                            equivalent to that of a province.[39] Based on law No. 5 of 1974 relating to regional
                            governments, the Jakarta Special Capital Region was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia
                            and
                            one of the country's then 26 provinces.[40] Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as
                            governor
                            from 1966 to 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, and built
                            hospitals
                            and a large number of schools. He cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects —
                            some
                            for the benefit of the Suharto family,[41]— and attempted to eliminate rickshaws and ban
                            street
                            vendors. He began control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty.[42]
                            Foreign
                            investment contributed to a real estate boom that transformed the face of Jakarta.[43] The
                            boom
                            ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, putting Jakarta at the centre of violence,
                            protest,
                            and political manoeuvrin.

                            After three decades in power, support for President Suharto began to wane. Tensions peaked
                            when
                            four students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces. Four days of riots
                            and
                            violence in 1998 ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000
                            buildings, forcing Suharto to resign.[44] Much of the rioting targeted Chinese
                            Indonesians.[45]
                            In the post-Suharto era, Jakarta has remained the focal point of democratic change in
                            Indonesia.[46] Jemaah Islamiyah-connected bombings occurred almost annually in the city
                            between
                            2000 and 2005,[30] with another in 2009.[47] In August 2007, Jakarta held its first-ever
                            election to choose a governor as part of a nationwide decentralisation program that allows
                            direct local elections in several areas. Previously, governors were elected by the city's
                            legislative body.[48]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the Jokowi presidency, the Government adopted a plan to move Indonesia's capital to
                            Nusantara after 17 August 2024,[49] but this doesn't occur due to delays.[50]

                            Between 2016 and 2017, a series of terrorist attacks rocked Jakarta with scenes of multiple
                            suicide bombings and gunfire. In suspicion of its links, the Islamic State, the perpetrator
                            led
                            by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi claimed responsibility for the attacks.
